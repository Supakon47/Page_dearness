    <p>
      Happy anniversary, my love! Every day with you has been a gift, but today feels extra special as we celebrate the journey we’ve shared so far.
      From the little moments that make us laugh to the challenges that make us stronger, I’m grateful for it all — because it’s with you.
      You’ve filled my life with so much warmth, happiness, and love that I can’t imagine my days without you in it.
      I still get butterflies thinking about how lucky I am to call you mine.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we look back on our memories, I can’t help but get excited about all the moments still ahead of us.
      I promise to keep loving you deeply, supporting you always, and choosing you every single day.
      Thank you for being my partner, my safe place, and my greatest blessing.
      Here’s to us — to everything we’ve built together, and to the endless love still to come.
      No matter where life takes us, I know we’ll always have each other.
    </p>
